                </header>
                
                

                <p>There are four species that are commonly referred to as kangaroos:</p>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        <b>The red kangaroo </b> <i>[Macropus rufus]</i> is the largest surviving marsupial anywhere in the world. The Red Kangaroo occupies the arid and semi-arid centre of the country. The highest population densities of the Red Kangaroo occur in the rangelands of western New South Wales. Red kangaroos are commonly mistaken as the most abundant species of kangaroo, but eastern greys actually have a larger population.</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <b>The eastern grey kangaroo</b> <i>[Macropus giganteus]</i> is less well-known than the red (outside Australia), but the most often seen, as its range covers the fertile eastern part of the country. The range of the Eastern Grey Kangaroo extends from the top of the Cape York Peninsula in north Queensland down to Victoria, as well as areas of south-eastern Australia and Tasmania.</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <b>The western grey kangaroo</b> <i>[Macropus fuliginosus]</i> is found in the southern part of Western Australia, South Australia near the coast, and the Darling River basin. The highest population densities occur in the western Riverina district of New South Wales and in western areas of the Nullarbor Plain in Western Australia. Populations may have declined, particularly in agricultural areas. </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <b>The antilopine kangaroo</b> <i>[Macropus antilopinus]</i> is essentially the far-northern equivalent of the eastern and western grey kangaroos. It is sometimes referred to as the ‘Antilopine Wallaroo,’ but in behaviour and habitat it is more similar to Red and grey kangaroos. Like them, it is a creature of the grassy plains and woodlands, and gregarious. Their name comes from their fur, which is similar in colour and texture to that of antelopes. Characteristically, the noses of males swell behind the nostrils. This enlarges nasal passages and allows them to release more heat in hot and humid climates.</p>
    </ul>

                <h4>LOCOMOTION</h4>
            </header>
                <p>
                 Kangaroos are the only large animals to use hopping as a means of locomotion. The comfortable hopping speed for a red kangaroo is about 13–16 mph, but speeds of up to 44 mph can be attained over short distances. This fast and energy-efficient method of travel has evolved because of the need to regularly cover large distances in search of food and water, rather than the need to escape predators.</p>

                <h5>DIET</h5>
            </header>
                    <p>Kangaroos have chambered stomachs similar to those of cattle and sheep. They regurgitate the vegetation they have eaten, chew it as cud, and then swallow it again for final digestion. Different species of kangaroos have different diets, although all are strict herbivores. The eastern grey kangaroo is predominantly a grazer, eating a wide variety of grasses, whereas some other species, like the red kangaroo, include significant amounts of shrubs in their diets. The smaller species of kangaroos also consume hypogeal fungi.</p>

                                   <b>FUN FACT:</b> Kangaroos <em>do not</em>  fart. Despite having herbivorous diets similar to ruminants such as cattle, which release large quantities of methane, kangaroos release virtually none. The hydrogen byproduct of fermentation is instead converted into acetate, which is then used to provide further energy.</small>

Because of its grazing, kangaroos have developed specialised teeth. Its incisors are able to crop grass close to the ground, and its molars chop and grind the grass. Since the two sides of the lower jaw are not joined together, the lower incisors are farther apart, giving the kangaroo a wider bite. The silica in grass is abrasive, so kangaroo molars move forward as they are ground down, and eventually fall out, replaced by new teeth that grow in the back. This process is known as <b>polyphyodonty</b> and amongst other mammals, only occurs in elephants and manatees.</p>

            <h6>REPRODUCTION</h6>                    
        </header>
            <p>Kangaroo reproduction is similar to that of opossums. The egg descends from the ovary into the uterus where it is fertilised and quickly develops into a neonate. Even in the largest kangaroo,the neonate emerges after only 33 days. Usually, only one young is born at a time. It is blind, hairless, and only a few centimetres long; its hindlegs are mere stumps; it instead uses its more developed forelegs to climb its way through the thick fur on its mother's abdomen into the pouch, which takes about three to five minutes. Once in the pouch, it fastens onto one of the four teats and starts to feed. Almost immediately, the mother's sexual cycle starts again. Another egg descends into the uterus and she becomes sexually receptive. Then, if she mates and a second egg is fertilised, its development is temporarily halted. Meanwhile, the neonate in the pouch grows rapidly. After about 190 days, the baby, or <b>joey,</b> is sufficiently large and developed to make its full emergence out of the pouch, after sticking its head out for a few weeks until it eventually feels safe enough to fully emerge. From then on, it spends increasing time in the outside world and eventually, after about 235 days, it leaves the pouch for the last time.</p>

                    <h7>SOCIAL BEHAVIOR</h7>
                </header>
                <p>Groups of kangaroos are called <b>mobs.</b> Mobs usually have 10 or more kangaroos in them. Living in mobs provides protection for some of the weaker members of the group. The size and stability of the mobs vary between geographic regions. Larger aggregations display high amounts of interactions and complex social structures. One common behaviour is nose touching and sniffing, which mostly occurs when an individual joins a group. The kangaroos performing the sniffing gain much information from smell cues. This behaviour enforces social cohesion without consequent aggression. During mutual sniffing, if one kangaroo is smaller, it will hold its body closer to the ground and its head will quiver; this is possibly a form of submission. Greetings between males and females are common, with larger males being the most involved in meeting females. </p>
                <p>Fighting has been described in all species of kangaroos. Fights between kangaroos can be brief or long and ritualised. In highly competitive situations such as males fighting for access to oestrous females or at limited drinking spots, the fights are brief. Both sexes will fight for drinking spots, but long, ritualised fighting or "boxing" is largely done by males. Smaller males fight more often near females in oestrus, while the large males in consorts do not seem to get involved. Ritualised fights can arise suddenly when males are grazing together. However, most fights are preceded by two males scratching and grooming each other. One or both of them will adopt a high standing posture, with one male issuing a challenge by grasping the other male’s neck with its forepaw. </p>
